# 📦 Inventory Optimization Recommendation System

## 📝 Project Overview

This project builds an **Inventory Optimization Recommendation System** that forecasts daily product demand using historical data, and recommends **optimal restocking thresholds** to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs. It simulates a real-world inventory pipeline with demand seasonality, stockout tracking, and reorder logic using **synthetic data**.

The system uses an **XGBoost Regression Model** trained on engineered time-based features and lagged demand to make accurate demand predictions. It then applies smoothing and business logic to determine optimal reorder points.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧪 **Synthetic Data Generation** for simulating SKU demand, stock levels, and stockouts  
- 🔁 **Lag Features** and **Moving Averages** to model temporal dependencies  
- 🎉 **Event Spike Simulation** for capturing seasonal/holiday demand surges  
- 📈 **XGBoost Regression Model** for forecasting next-day demand  
- 📊 **Rolling Forecast + Smoothing** for stable restocking thresholds  
- ✅ **Visualization** of:
  - Actual vs Predicted Demand  
  - Optimal Restocking Threshold  
  - Stockout Events over time  
- 📉 **RMSE Calculation** to evaluate prediction accuracy

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **XGBoost** – regression model for forecasting  
- **Scikit-learn** – RMSE metric and train/test split  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualizing demand and inventory behavior

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-optimization.git
cd inventory-optimization

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate


# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
### 3. Install Dependencies

pip install pandas numpy xgboost matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
### ▶️ Usage
Run the notebook:


Inventory_Optimization_Recommendation_System.ipynb
This will:

Generate 3 years of synthetic demand & inventory data

Perform feature engineering with lags, moving averages, and event spike tags

Train an XGBoost regression model to forecast next-day demand

Calculate rolling smoothed forecasts

Compute optimal restocking thresholds using lead time and safety stock logic

Display a complete visual plot of demand, prediction, threshold, and stockouts

### 📊 Output Visualization
The final plot shows:

📈 Actual Daily Demand

🔮 Predicted Demand

🟩 Optimal Restocking Threshold

❌ Stockout Events (marked in red)

Example:

The green curve helps inventory managers decide when to reorder.

The red crosses show when stockouts occurred historically.

The forecast adapts to seasonal or spike events.

### 📏 Evaluation Metric
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
The RMSE metric is printed on the console after model evaluation.
It reflects average prediction error — the lower, the better.

### 📌 Next Steps
Integrate real historical sales/inventory datasets

Add external signals like promotions or weather

Tune XGBoost hyperparameters

Extend model to multiple SKUs and inventory classes

Use cost-based restocking strategies
